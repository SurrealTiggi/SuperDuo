This repo contains the Super Duo project as part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

**NOTE:**

*In order for the API calls to work, you'll have to create an <b>api.xml</b> file inside <b>app/src/main/res/values/</b> containing your own api key as follows:*

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="API_KEY">YOUR KEY HERE</string>
</resources>
```
